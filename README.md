# ü™º Jelly-Clipper üé¨

Jelly-Clipper is an open-source web application that allows Jellyfin users to easily create, share, and manage video clips from their Jellyfin media library

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is my first open source project, and it was very much a hacky "lets try to make it work somehow" thing.
> So absolutely feel free to contribute and fix all the stuff I did wrong :D

## üåü Features

- **Simple Clip Creation**: Paste a URL and create clips with ease
- **Seamless Jellyfin Integration**: Works directly with your self-hosted Jellyfin server
- **User Authentication**: Clips are only accessible for other users of the Jellyfin instance
- **Easy Sharing**: Generate shareable links for your favorite moments
- **User-Friendly(-ish) Interface**: Intuitive design inspired by YouTube and Twitch clip functionality

## ‚ùì How does this work?

This tool takes a very simple approach:

1. Jelly-Clipper downloads the original file from jellyfin
2. The user can create their clip
3. The clip will be saved indefinitely in their profile and is accessible for other members of the jellyfin instance
4. The downloaded original files get cleaned up regularly, if they're older than 2 days, to save storage

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Installation

Jelly-Clipper is easily hostable with docker compose:

```yaml
services:
  jelly-clipper:
    image: ghcr.io/arnolicious/jelly-clipper:latest
    container_name: jelly-clipper
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      # Path to the db directory, in which the sqlite db file will live
      - <MY_DB_PATH>:/app/db
      # Path to the videos directory.
      # This will store all the clips permanently and the original files temporarily,
      # so it might get a lil big
      - <MY_VIDEOS_PATH>:/app/assets/videos
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Timezone to have the cleanup cron job working as expected
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
      # Full URL with Protocol and Port, where the application will live
      - JELLY_CLIPPER_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
      # with a reverse proxy it could be something like:
      # - JELLY_CLIPPER_ORIGIN=https://clip.jellyfin.mydomain.test
```
